# Coloredmap-for-Fivem
SERVER SIDE Coloredmap replace for Fivem Server

Note: This was NOT my OWN mod, I've just remaked it and inserted some new actions. If you want you can insert and change values if you want for your own!! Fixed for new Citizen and map ZOOM fixed!

If you zoom inside the map and you can see the default black/blank map insert these rows inside 1 of your mod's client.lua
